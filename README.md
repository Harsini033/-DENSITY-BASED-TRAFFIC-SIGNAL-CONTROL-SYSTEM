# -DENSITY-BASED-TRAFFIC-SIGNAL-CONTROL-SYSTEM
The Density Based Traffic Signal Control System controls traffic signals based on real-time traffic density. Sensors or cameras detect the number of vehicles on each road. The signal timing is adjusted so that roads with more traffic get longer green signals, while less crowded roads get shorter times. This system reduces traffic congestion.
